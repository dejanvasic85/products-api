# Recommendations

After running out of time, I believe the following still needs to be addressed to make a production ready app:
   
- Service layer to contain the validation and logic of the application
- API Versioning
- Performance - GetProducts should be including (pagination and filtering)
- Caching configuration
- Logging (http request logging as well as latency)
- Logging (errors through middleware)
- Monitoring / Metrics
- Dockerize (packaging)
- Integration Tests
- Case sensitive responses? The requirements display Pascal Casing but the project is defined as regular camelCasing (recommended)
 

- Changing the POST (generate ID)
- Request Models? 
- Validation
